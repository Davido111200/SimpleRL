# SimpleRL
An implementation of very basic RL algorithms

This repo only include simple algorithms on simple environments 

Current algorithms:
  - Offline Lambda-return (grid world)
  - REINFORCE ( short corridor)
  - Actor Critic (Cartpole-v1)
  - Q-learning (Taxi-v3, FrozenLake-v1)
  - Deep Q-Network (CartPole-v1)
  - Priortized Experience Replay (PER) (Breakout-v5)
  - N-step SARSA (FrozenLake-v1)
  - SARSA (FrozenLake-v1)
